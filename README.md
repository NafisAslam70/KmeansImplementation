# KmeansImplementation

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a set of k distinct, non-overlapping subgroups. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm, along with a simple example demonstrating its usage.
